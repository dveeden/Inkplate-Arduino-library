   Inkplate_SD_TXT example for e-radionica.com Inkplate 6PLUS
   For this example you will need only a micro USB cable, Inkplate 6PLUS and a SD card
   loaded with text.txt file that can be found inside folder of this example.
   Select "Inkplate 6PLUS(ESP32)" from Tools -> Board menu.
   Don't have "Inkplate 6PLUS(ESP32)" option? Follow our tutorial and add it:
   https://e-radionica.com/en/blog/add-inkplate-6-to-arduino-ide/

   To work with SD card on Inkplate, you will need to add one extra library.
   Download and install it from here: https://github.com/e-radionicacom/Inkplate-6-SDFat-Arduino-Library

   You can open your own .txt file, but in order to this example works properly it should
   not have more than 200 chars and you should name it text.txt

   This example will show you how to open .txt files and display the content of that file on Inkplate epaper display.
